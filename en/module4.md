# Module 4 -- Crossing data from several sources {#module4}

## Objectives:
- Use dictionaries to associate information
- Cross data from different data sources

## Input:
- File: [selected2.csv](files/selected2.csv)
    - created in module 2
- File: [sequences.csv](files/sequences.csv)
    - created in module 3

## Output:
- File: `paths_enzymes.csv`

## Steps:

1. Start by creating an empty `module4.py` file.

2. We will first read the file `sequences.csv` so that we can build a dictionary where each enzyme is associated with its own aminoacid sequence.
As such, add this to your `module4.py`, filling in the question marks:
```python
    import csv
    
    # Read the CSV file
    f = open('sequences.csv')
    enzymes = csv.reader(f, delimiter=???)
    
    # Create an empty dictionary that we will populate as we read the CSV
    # file
    dict_sequences = {}
    
    # For each of the enzymes in the file, associate the enzyme with its
    # sequence
    for enzyme in enzymes:
        enzyme_id = enzyme[???] # The ID of this enzyme
        seq = enzyme[???]       # The aminoacid sequence of this enzyme
        dict_sequences[enzyme_id] = seq
    
    f.close()
```

3. Then we will read the file `selected2.csv` and associate each pathway with the list of enzymes that are part of it.
We will also use a dictionary for this task:
```python
    # Read the CSV file
    f = open('selected2.csv')
    paths = csv.reader(f, delimiter=???)
    
    # Create an empty dictionary that we will populate as we read the CSV
    # file
    dict_paths = {}
    
    # For each pathway in that file:
    # - extract the list of enzymes in the pathway
    # - associate the pathway with this list of enzymes
    for path in paths:
        path_id = path[???] # The ID of the pathways
        enzymes = path[???] # The field of the enzymes
        
        # Break that information into a list
        enzyme_list = str.split(enzymes, ???)
        
        # Associate the pathway ID with the corresponding list of enzymes
        dict_paths[???] = ???
    
    f.close()
```

4. Now that we have the two dictionaries, we can go through each pathway and through each enzyme in it and create a CSV file that crosses the information, associating each pathway to the aminoacid sequences of its enzymes.
To do so, add this final piece of code to your script:
```python
    # Open a file to save the output
    f = open('paths_enzymes.csv', 'wb')
    w = csv.writer(f, delimiter=???)
    
    # For each pathway and each enzyme that it contains
    for path_id in dict_paths :
        # Let's print some debugging information
        print 'Processing pathway with ID ' + path_id
        
        # Retrieve the list of enzymes associated with this pathway
        enzyme_list = dict_paths[???]
        
        # Now that we have the list of enzymes, associate the pathway with each
        # aminoacid sequence
        for enzyme_id in enzyme_list:
            # Some more debugging information
            print '  enzyme = ' + enzyme_id
            
            # Retrieve the sequence associated with this enzyme
            seq = dict_sequences[???]
            
            # Write this row to the CSV file
            w.writerow([path_id, seq])
    
    f.close()
```

5. Run the code and take notice of the file that was created (`paths_enzymes.csv`).
Does it correspond to what you were expecting to see?

6. Make sure you keep a copy of the `paths_enzymes.csv` file to yourself, so that you can use it in the next modules.
For example, send it to you by email or upload it to Dropbox.



## After the class:
1. Change the selection criterion used to create the file `selected2.csv` (for example selecting only the pathways with at most 10 enzymes, as proposed in the quiz of module 2).
Then change the code of today's module to accommodate this change.
