# Module 1 -- Metabolic pathways data {#module1}

## Objectives:

-  Analyze and understand metabolic pathway data.

## Input:

- File: [metabolic_pathways.xls](files/metabolic_pathways.xls)

## Steps:

1. Analyze the following figure that represents the [metabolic pathway of glycolysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis) that decomposes glucose in smaller chemical compounds.

2. Open your Personal Area on your computer and create a folder named module1.

3. Save the file `metabolic_pathways.xls` given as input in the previous folder.

4. Open the previous file in Excel. The data it contains comes from an online database called [Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kegg2.html).
The enzymes are referred by their UniProt code. [UniProt](http://www.uniprot.org/) is a database of proteins that contain, among a vast amount of information, the aminoacid sequences of the proteins.

5. Find how many metabolic pathways it contains.

6. Find the name of the pathway with the identifier hsa03030.

7. Find the identifier of the pathway with the name "Insulin secretion".

8. Find the name of the pathways that belong to the class "Metabolism; Energy metabolism".
 
9. Find the name of the pathways in which the enzyme "Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1" with identifier [P18440](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P18440) participates.
