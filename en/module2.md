1. Open your Personal Area on your computer and create a folder named `module2`.

2. Save the file `metabolic_pathways.xls` given as input in the previous folder.

    b. The `Save As` dialog box appears
    
    c. In the `Save as type` box, choose `CSV (Comma delimited)`.

5. Open the CSV file in a text editor (Notepad) and find how many commas has each line.

6. Verify that some fields in the CSV file are delimited by quotes <span class="nobr">(`"`)</span> and other are not.
Explain why.

7. Open the CSV file in Excel.

8. Make sure you keep a copy of the files, so you can use them afterwards.
For example, send it to you by email or upload it to Dropbox.
